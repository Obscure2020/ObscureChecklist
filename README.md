# Obscure's Checklist
This utility is designed to allow me to easily keep a to-do list of both personal tasks and assignments with date/time deadlines.

If you'd like to use it for yourself, do so at your own risk. This program is ***VERY*** incomplete at this time. For crying out loud, I didn't even tell the program what to do if `Book.dat` isn't present.

I am planning on adding support for changing the value and type of any task, as well as storing and reading descriptions of tasks.

I'll probably also write a better Readme, and maybe even a how-to-use guide after I add more features. What's present so far is enough for me to start testing it out in daily use. I'll add more features when I can find time, when they occur to me, or when I find a use for them.
